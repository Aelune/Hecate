# Toggle Waybar Visibility
# This command sends the SIGUSR1 signal to the Waybar process.
# Waybar is configured to toggle its visibility (hide/show) when it receives SIGUSR1.
# It does NOT terminate the process â€” it just tells Waybar to hide or show itself.

bind = SUPER CTRL ALT, B, exec, pkill -SIGUSR1 waybar
